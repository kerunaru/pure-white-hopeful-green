## pure white. hopeful green spress theme

pure white.hopeful green is a minimalism theme for **[spress 2.0](http://spress.yosymfony.com)** using a four colours palette.

it's mainly inspired in the traditional colours of my country: Andalusia. using Open Sans as main font family.

i've followed the kiss principle, this means, it's possible the structure of the theme is not as modular as others but this is intentional for the sake of code readability.

following minimalism i only show one post per page and just two pages by default: "blog" and "about" page. images are expected to be full width by the same philosophy.

**this theme requires Spress >= 2.0**.
